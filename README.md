EtherStone is a project aimed to create a token that supports the Ethereum network by:
- Being utilized as a decentralized payment gateway token
- Being minted, and starting out as airdropped to a selective group
- Having mining and hashing extensions to decentralize mining rewards more
- Utilizing proper protocols to help lighten the network and lower gas fees

Currently the creator of EtherStone, believes that the Ethereum network is getting quite heavy and seemingly more centralized, which is why this project was created. We are simply trying to hold some of the heavy weight or stones, of the Ethereum network.
