# EtherStone

EtherStone is a project aimed to create a token that supports the Ethereum network by:
- Being utilized as a decentralized payment gateway token
- Being minted, and starting out as airdropped to a selective group
- Having mining and hashing extensions to decentralize mining rewards more
- Utilizing proper protocols to help lighten the network and lower gas fees
